00:00.000 --> 00:01.000 
Many of us 
00:01.000 --> 00:03.000
have perished
00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
in inner space. 
00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
We died 
00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
on your counters 
00:07 .000 --> 00:10.000
and behind your baseboards. 
00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Some of us died in outer space. 
00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
We died in laboratories on earth 
00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
and in orbit. 
00:20.000 --> 00:21.000 
Our bodies 
00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
have stood in for your bodies 
00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
our pain 
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
has stood in for your pain.
