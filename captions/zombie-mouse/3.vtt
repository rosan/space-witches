00:00.000 --> 00:03.000 
The cities and houses we inhabit 
00:03.000 --> 00:05.000 
are an archive
00:05.000 --> 00:07.000 
brick and concrete fossils
00:07.000 --> 00:08.000 
of a dying 
00:08.000 --> 00:09.000 
calcifying 
00:09.000 --> 00:12.000 
patriarchal order. 
00:13.000 --> 00:14.000 
When we move our bodies
00:14.000 --> 00:17.000 
through your walls
00:18.000 --> 00:20.000 
along your skirting boards
00:21.000 --> 00:22.000 
we trace the histories
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000 
of your gender norms
00:24.000 --> 00:25.000 
the annals 
00:25.000 --> 00:28.000 
of oppression.
