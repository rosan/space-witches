00:00.000 --> 00:01.000 
During the accumulation
00:01.000 --> 00:03.000 
the land was expropriated 
00:04.000 --> 00:06.000 
and we were gathered together 
00:06.000 --> 00:08.000 
and cloven in two. 
00:07.000 --> 00:09.000 
On the one side
00:09.000 --> 00:11.000  
there were made the waged workers
00:11.000 --> 00:15.000  
alien and disconnected from the means of production.
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000 
On the other 
00:17.000 --> 00:20.000 
we, who could produce these workers
00:20.000 --> 00:22.000  
we who cared for each other 
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000 
we were set against one another 
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000 
so that our power might be broken 
00:27.000 --> 00:29.000 
so that we too would be accumulated 
00:29.000 --> 00:31.000 
be controlled.
