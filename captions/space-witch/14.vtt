00:00.000 --> 00:03.000 
As the isolation of the home increased
00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
and waged labor became accumulated
00:05.000 --> 00:06.000 
automated 
00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
and specialized 
00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
so did reproductive labor 
00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
become more isolated 
00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
more individualized. 
00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
We were forced out of the commons 
00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
into inner space 
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
into the interior.
