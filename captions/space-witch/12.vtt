00:00.000 --> 00:01.000 
These long years 
00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
we have waited 
00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
we have been foul 
00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
and unproductive 
00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
and we have withheld 
00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
we have done caring magics 
00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
and destructive magics 
00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
of the interior 
00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
but now 
00:12.000 --> 00:13 .000
now we have returned.
00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
We travelled inwards 
00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
and gained the knowledge
00:16.000 --> 00:17.000 
and power 
00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
of the interior 
00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
and now have returned 
00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
to create a continuum 
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
of inner and outer space
00:24.000 --> 00:25.000 
sharing the body 
00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
and the labor 
00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
that goes to maintaining the body
00:29.000 --> 00:30.000 
and birthing the body
00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
and caring for the body
00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
and feeding the body
00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
to assert the total 
00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
primacy of reproductive
00:36.000 --> 00:38.000 
labor over waged labor
00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
expanding in- and -outwards
00:40.000 --> 00:41.000 
with love 
00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
and learning 
00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
and care 
00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
and the rage 
00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
burned into us by generations.
