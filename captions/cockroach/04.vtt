00:07.000 --> 00:09.000 
The sun was setting 
00:09.000 --> 00:13.000 
as we arrived at the Baikonur Cosmodrome 
00:13.000 --> 00:14.000 
Weeds and grasses 
00:14.000 --> 00:16.000 
pushed up the pavement 
00:16.000 --> 00:18.000 
and the site was nearly abandoned  
00:18.000 --> 00:20.000 
in the falling dusk.
00:20.000 --> 00:22.000 
We were decanted 
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000 
into a special container 
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000 
and fed into the re-entry capsule 
00:27.000 --> 00:30.000 
of the unmanned Foton spacecraft. 
00:33.000 --> 00:34.000 
That night
00:34.000 --> 00:36.000 
I dreamed I had been summoned 

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000 
but when I awoke 

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000 
the dream slipped from my mind.
